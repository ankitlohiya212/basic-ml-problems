# Basic Machine Learning Problems
This repo is for all the beginners in the Machine Learning Field.
In this repo I've written code for solving some of the basic machine learning problems. Most of these problems are listed as assignments for the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng. The only thing is that the problems are solved in Python.
Some of these problems are solved using python libraries and some are solved by hand coding from scratch which was much more of a learning experience.
